1) For 7,
counter = 1
faults = 1
frames[0] = 7
time[0] = 1

2) For 5,
counter = 2
faults = 2
frames[1] = 5
time[1] = 2

3) For 9,
counter = 3
faults = 3
frames[2] = 9
time[2] = 3

4) For 4,
min = time[0] = 1
min is not greater than 
time[1] = 2
time[2] = 3
So, pos = 0
counter = 4
faults = 4
frames[pos = 0] = 4
time[pos = 0] = 4


5) For 3,
min = time[0] = 4
min is greater than time[1]
time[1] = 2
time[2] = 3
So, pos = 1
counter = 5
faults = 5
frames[pos = 1] = 4
time[pos = 0] = 4
