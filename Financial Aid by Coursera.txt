I am a Computer Science student. And I am trying to learn new programming languages. This Python course will be very helpful for me to work with new projects. But I will not be able to pay for this course at all. Because as I said earlier, firstly, I am still a student. Secondly, I have not started earning yet. Again, my financial condition is not good during this pandemic. Therefore, there is no way for me to pay for this course. But it is very important for me to do this course right now. This is why I need Financial Aid. If I get the opportunity to do this course with the help of Financial Aid, then I will be very grateful. I will fully complete the course and utilise the opportunity my best. But it will not be possible to do this course, if I do not get any financial support. So, I badly need this Financial Aid.

Since I am a Computer Science student, learning new programming languages is very important for me. Python is a powerful language, and it is very important for me to learn the language, and I also want to work on new projects by the help of the knowledge I will be gaining by learning the language. Working on projects will help me to gain new experience which is a step towards achieving my goals. This is why I need to do this course. But I need financial support right now, otherwise I will not be able to pay and do this course at all. If I get the opportunity to do this course with the help of Financial Aid, then I will be very grateful. I will fully complete the course and utilise the opportunity my best.
